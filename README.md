## About

Over the years, there have been a variety of visual reasoning tasks that evaluate machines’ ability to understand and reason about visual scenes. However, these benchmarks mostly focus on classification of objects and items that exist in a scene. Common sense reasoning – an understanding of what might happen next, or what gave rise to the scene – is often absent in these benchmarks. Humans, on the other hand, are highly versatile, adept in numerous high-level cognition-related visual reasoning tasks that go beyond pattern recognition and require common sense (e.g., physics, causality, functionality, psychology, etc).
